## B2B Concepts
### Account Management
```
When selling to organizations, there’s often a need to have multiple layers of accounts. 
There will typically be a “Parent” account for the organization and various levels of “Sub-Accounts” 
in which company employees can make purchases on behalf of the larger organization.

### Inventory Availability Information
- 재고 회사의 배송일, 재고여부에 따라 상품 구매 결정이 난다.
- 이 시스템은 고객 유치에 도움을 줄수 있다.
```
Often a buyer’s decision to order from company A vs. 
company B comes down to who has the inventory and when it can be delivered. 
The ability to give up-to-date and accurate availability information becomes instrumental in gaining and retaining customers, 
while minimizing the workload of providing manual estimates over the phone.
```

### Pricing
```
The other key metric buyers use in their purchasing decision is price. 
It’s essential to provide competitive pricing and 
to have the ability to showcase various price points based on economies of scale. 
Typically, this is highlighted in quantity-based pricing and various price tiers, 
based on the volume of product that a customer orders. 
These can also be pre-established price rates that a sales rep has negotiated with the customer. 
Whatever the methodology, it’s critical to provide accurate pricing based on the account that is logged in, 
and also display potentially better price points to encourage increased ordering.
```

### Bulk Order & Re-Ordering
```
Sale orders in B2B eCommerce often have large quantities: tens, hundreds or even thousands of items on a single order. 
Retail eCommerce platforms struggle with the usability of the data at this scale. 
Bulk order entry requires a different user interface to allow key features, 
such as the ability to duplicate a previous order and use it as a starting point for new orders, which make the system useable.
```

### Payment Methods & Approval Cahins
```
In B2B eCommerce, it’s not uncommon for transaction totals to reach thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Using credit cards for transactions of that size simply isn’t logical for many companies,
so it’s critical to allow the submission of Purchase Orders, with terms. 
However, offering this service requires work on a number of additional functional requirements such as establishing credit limits, 
entering PO numbers, generating invoices and tracking invoice payments. 
In addition, the system should provide a process for an employee to initiate a transaction and then have it approved by someone in procurement or finance.
```

### Multiple Fullfillments & Shipping Addresses
```
When placing large orders, a customer may need to have items shipped to multiple locations. 
There are many features, outlined below, that can assist in this process. 
Additionally, it’s essential for the eCommerce application to determine the best location to send goods from when providing shipping rate quotes. 
Providing real time, accurate, and competitive shipping rates is extremely important to gain new customers, 
satisfy existing customers and optimize shipping costs and timing.
```

### System Integrations
```
Lastly, it’s important to note that product catalog, inventory levels, account information, 
and order/fulfillment details may need to be pushed and pulled from third party systems such as ERP, CRM, Account, Warehouse Management or other software applications. 
In fact, both vendor systems and customer systems often need to be integrated. 
It’s critical that the eCommerce system be able to easily integrate with these types of platforms and do real-time data handoffs when appropriate.
